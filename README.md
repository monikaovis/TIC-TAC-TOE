## Tic Tac Toe Game
This project is a simple implementation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe, developed in Visual Studio using Html, Java script, and CSS language. The game is played between two players, who take turns marking their respective symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

### GAME RULES:
A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual game uses “X” and “O”.

The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (we call him/her player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (we call him/her player 2).

Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.

A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intensions:
a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
